There are many people who are trying to steal and harm my information. However, there are 3 ways to prevent it. The first is not to connect into any wifis that are free. There are many risks if I go into a unknown wifi. The owner of the wifi can see the whole thing what I am doing on the computer.

Next is that an offender would try to put a virus in my computer. This can occur when downloading an unknown file in a unsafe place. This occurs a lot when one tries to download a file but does not want to pay any money, so illegally. However, it can be very dangerous. Because there might be inordinate virus in the file.

Finally, the most often way an offender might use is going into other people's SNS pages. People post their private lives such as leisure or hanging out with their friends or their house pictures. However, if they do so, and make their posts public, all the people can search on Internet to find one another's information. Therefore, putting the SNS accounts into private or to make it seen only by the friends is a good way to protect information.
